<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> My name is Sabin Sidney, and I am excited to begin my education journey with everyone in this class. I was born in Bulgaria but adopted by my American parents and raised outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I graduated from Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC, with a B.S. in Finance. After my undergraduate degree, I moved to Washington, D.C. for three years before moving to Tallahassee almost two years ago in January 2021.</p>
<h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Reading and writing about politics</li>
    <li>Binging Survivor, Silicon Valley, and Modern Family</li>
    <li>Walking and working out</li>
    <li>Interested in anything aviation-related and learning how to fly</li>
    <li>Board games and sometimes Xbox</li>
    <li>Cat person</li>
</ol>
<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p>My career began with an unpaid internship on Capitol Hill. However, during those pivotal three years in Washington, I was fortunate to experience a vast range of exposure to American politics. For example, I had the opportunity to work in the communications shop at the Republican Attorneys General Association during the 2018 midterm cycle. After that, I served at the U.S. Department of Labor, even in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. I have since served in the Florida Legislature and the Governor's Executive Office, working closely with high-ranking elected officials and members of the Governor's staff. I am now working privately for a federal consulting firm working on communications. However, my goal after completing the Master's degree is to work on a 2024 campaign and ultimately return to government service, hopefully in a Presidential Administration.</p>
